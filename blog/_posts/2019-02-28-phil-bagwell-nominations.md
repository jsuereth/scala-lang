title: "Phil Bagwell Nominations"
---

It's almost ScalaDays and that means it's time to select Phil Bagwell award winners!  This year we're taking the time to formalize the rubric used to select winners, as well as make it more obvious who makes the decisions.

We've drafted the formal [rubric](http://scala-lang.org/community/phil_bagwell_award.html) for all to read.  The essential gist is:

* We recognize people who make us proud to be part of the community
* Winners should contribute their time in one or more of the following:
  - Technical Contribution
  - Activism
  - Evangelism

Additionally, the committee to select award winners will consist of Martin Odersky and all previous winners of the award (who have time to take part).

The selection process will first involve soliciting nominations from the community.  Please let us know who you think meets the published [rubric](http://scala-lang.org/community/phil_bagwell_award.html) and why.  The committee will hold voting late March to select the 2018 and 2019 winners and they will be announced at ScalaDays 2019 in Lausanne.

So, please forward all submissions to bagwellaward@gmail.com!

Looking forward to hearing from you all,

Josh Suereth on behalf of the Phil Bagwell award committee
